# Defines the podcast clients and how they're matched
#
#   Col 0, a unique code that labels the client, this need not appear in order,
#   just be a unique number. This number will remain stable between version.
#
#   Col 1, a name that identifies the client, this need not be unique
#
#   Col 2 to n, a series of match strings for the client.
#   These are regexes as defined at:
#   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
#
# When a client-agent is matched each row is applied in turn, and so
# where two clients could possibly be matched the client that appears
# first here will take precedence.
